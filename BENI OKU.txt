SOUND SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING
This project consists of 3 main steps:

Step We will prepare our dataset for analysis and extract sound signal features from audio files using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCC).

Then we will build a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model and train our model with our dataset.

Finally we predict an audio file's class using our model.

We will use UrbanSound8K Dataset, download Link is here: https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/download-urbansound8k.html

Dataset folder and this source code should be on same directory..

Don't forget to install librosa library using anaconda promt with the following command line:

conda install -c conda-forge librosa
